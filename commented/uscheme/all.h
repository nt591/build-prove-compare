 * Streams
 * 
 * An evaluator works by repeatedly calling [[getxdef]]
 * on a stream of [[XDef]]s. Behind the scenes, there's
 * a lot going on:
 * 
 *   ‚Ä¢ Each [[XDef]] is produced from a parenthesized
 *  phrase, for example something like \monobox(val n
 *  0) or \monobox(define id (x) x). A parenthesized
 *  phrase, which in the code is called [[Par]], is
 *  simply a fragment of the input in which
 *  parentheses are balanced; converting a
 *  parenthesized phrase to an expression or an
 *  extended definition is the job of the parser
 *  presented in \crefcparse.chap. Producing
 *  parenthesized phrases, however, is done here;
 *  function [[parstream]] produces a stream of
 *  [[Par]]s, called [[Parstream]], and [[getpar]]
 *  takes a [[Parstream]] and produces a [[Par]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ A [[Par]] is found on one or more input lines.
 *  (And an input line may contain more than one
 *  [[Par]].) A [[Parstream]] is produced from a
 *  [[Linestream]], and a [[Linestream]] may be
 *  produced either from a string or from an input
 *  file.
 * 
 * Each stream follows the same pattern: there are one
 * or more functions to create streams, and there's a
 * function to get a thing from a stream. Their
 * implementations are also similar. All the streams and
 * their implementations are presented in this section.
 * I present streams of lines first, then parenthesized
 * phrases, and finally extended definitions. That way,
 * as you read each implementation, you'll be familiar
 * with what it depends on.

 * 20~years before the POSIX function was standardized,
 * and I'm too stubborn to change.] The [[getline_]]
 * function prints a prompt, reads the next line of
 * input from the source, and returns a pointer to the
 * line. Client code needn't worry about how long the
 * line is; [[getline_]] allocates enough memory to hold
 * it. Because [[getline_]] reuses the same memory to
 * hold successive lines, it is an unchecked run-time
 * error to retain a pointer returned by [[getline_]]
 * after a subsequent call to [[getline_]]. A client
 * that needs to save input characters must copy the

/*
 * Parsing parenthesized phrases (including Impcore)
 * in C
 * 
 * [*][*] \invisiblelocaltableofcontents[*]
 * 
 * A key step in the implementation of any programming
 * language is to translate the concrete syntax that
 * appears in the input to the abstract syntax that is
 * used internally. This translation is typically
 * implemented in two steps: lexical analysis groups
 * related characters into tokens, and parsing
 * translates a sequence of tokens into one or more
 * abstract-syntax trees. In the second part of this
 * book, starting with \crefmlscheme.chap, interpreters
 * are written in Standard ML, and they follow exactly
 * this model. But in the first part, where interpreters
 * are written in C, follows a different model:
 * sequences of lines are turned into parenthesized
 * phrases (\crefcinterps.parstream), and these phrases
 * are what is parsed into abstract syntax. The details
 * are the subject of this appendix.
 * 
 * Considering what I hope you'll get out of this book,
 * the implementation of a parser is a side issue.
 * Parsing is an art and a science all its own, and
 * it is the subject of its own learned textbooks. Using
 * parenthesized phrases enables me to avoid the usual
 * challenges and complexities. In their place, however,
 * I have one challenge that is central to what I hope
 * you get out of this book‚Äîto get the most out of the
 * Exercises, you have to be able to add new syntactic
 * forms. Using the parser I describe below, adding new
 * syntactic forms is relatively easy: you add new
 * entries to a couple of tables and a new case to a
 * [[switch]] statement in a syntax-building function.
 * But there is a cost: there's a lot of infrastructure
 * to understand. Infrastructure is easier to understand
 * if you can see how it's used, so along with the
 * general parsing infrastructure, I present the code
 * used to parse Impcore. But if you want to avoid
 * studying infrastructure and just get on with adding
 * new syntax, jump to the example and checklist in \
 * crefpage(cparse.conditional-sugar.
 * 
 * The parser in this appendix is easy for you to
 * extend, and it happens to be reasonably efficient,
 * but regrettably, it is not simple. However, it is
 * based on classic ideas developed by \citet
 * knuth:translation-left-right, so if you study it, you
 * will have a leg up on the ``LR parsers'' which so
 * dominated the second half of the twentieth century. [
 * Given the severe memory constraints imposed by
 * machines of the 1970s, LR-parser generators like Yacc
 * and Bison were brilliant innovations. In~the 21st
 * century, we~have memory to burn, and you are better
 * off choosing a parsing technology that will enable
 * you to spend more time getting work done and less
 * time engineering your grammar. But I digress.]
