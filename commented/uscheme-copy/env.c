 * Code that is changed to support garbage \
 * chaptocsplitcollection
 * 
 * When the garbage collector is deployed, most parts of
 * the \uschemeplus interpreter are either replaced
 * completely or are used without change. But a few
 * parts are modified versions of the originals. The
 * modifications help to keep track of the root set:
 * any code that can allocate is modified to make sure
 * that before [[allocloc]] is called, the root set is
 * up to date.
 * 
 * To keep the root set up to date, my code abuses the
 * stack of evaluation contexts. If it needs to save an
 * [[Exp]] or an [[Env]], for example, my code pushes an
 * appropriate context. Because the context is popped
 * immediately after the allocation, these abusive
 * contexts are never seen by the evaluator, and
 * therefore they don't interfere with it. (If my code
 * needs to save a [[Value]], it simply uses [[pushreg]]
 * or [[pushregs]] as intended.)
 * 
 * Code that is modified or added to support garbage
 * collection is shown in typewriter italics.
 * 
 * Revised environment-extension routines
 * 
 * To be sure that the current environment is always
 * visible to the garbage collector, \usp needs a new
 * version of [[bindalloc]]. When [[bindalloc]] is
 * called, its [[env]] argument contains bindings to
 * heap-allocated locations. \qbreak And because [[env]]
 * is a local variable in [[eval]], it doesn't appear on
 * the stack of evaluation contexts. It gets put on the
 * stack so that when [[allocate]] is called, the
 * bindings in [[env]] are kept live.

 * is called, this copy of [[val]] is deadâ€”only
 * [[allocate]]'s private copy matters.
 * 
 * In [[bindalloclist]], by contrast, when [[bindalloc]]
 * is called with [[vs->hd]], not everything is dead.
 * The value [[vs->hd]] is dead, as is everything that
 * precedes it on list [[vs]]. But values reachable from
 * [[vs->tl]] are still live. To make them visible to
