 * 
 * A brief example
 * 
 * I illustrate copying collection using a heap of
 * size 20. Suppose there are three roots, and the heap
 * looks like this: \pssetarrowsize=2pt 3 \xeheapdemo0
 * The reachable S-expressions are all part of one list;
 * two cons cells point to the same symbol [[b]]:
 * 
 *  \pssetlevelsep=24pt,treesep=40pt \pstree\Tp \
 *  rnode[t]blog\constree\TR\heapsymboxa \constree\Tn
 *  \constree\TR\heapsymboxb\niltree \nccurve[angleA=
 *  225,angleB=135]->T-0-0-1carT-0-0-1-1-0 \ncline->
 *  T-0blog
 * 
 * The collector begins by forwarding the roots. After
 * the first root is forwarded, the heap looks like
 * this: \xeheapdemo1 The first object in from-space has
 * been copied into to-space and replaced with a
 * forwarding pointer, which is shown with a
 * dotted line. The root now points to the copy, with
 * the pointer passing ``behind'' from-space so as not
 * to clutter the diagram. The copied object, as shown
 * by its thick border, is now gray. (Objects in the top
 * row are white.)
 * 
 * \qbreak After all three roots have been forwarded,
 * that is, after the execution of the first loop in
 * [[]], the
 * heap looks like this: \xeheapdemo3 Now the collector
 * starts scanning the gray objects located between
 * [[scanp]] and [[hp]]. Gray objects point to white
 * objects, which in a copying collector means that the
 * internal pointers in these objects point back to
 * from-space.
 * 
 * Scanning the first two gray objects does not change
 * the heap, because these objects have no internal
 * pointers. (But once [[scanp]] moves past them, the
 * first two gray objects are considered black.)
 * Scanning the third gray object (the pair) forwards
 * its two internal pointers. The symbol [['a]] has
 * already been copied into to-space, so forwarding the
 * [[car]] doesn't copy any data; it just adjusts a
 * pointer: \xeheapdemo4 Forwarding the [[cdr]] requires
 * copying another pair into to-space, however. After
 * this copy, the collector increments [[scanp]], and
 * the newly copied pair is now the only gray objectâ€”the
 * first three objects in to-space are black. \
 * xeheapdemo5
 * 
 * The collector continues copying objects pointed to by
 * [[*scanp]] until eventually [[scanp]] catches up with
 * [[hp]]. Now to-space holds only black objects \qbreak
 * and from-space holds only white objects. From-space
 * can be discarded, and the mutator can resume
 * execution. Its next allocation requests will be
 * satisfied using the four locations recovered in
 * to-space. \xeheapdemo10 By using forwarding pointers,
 * the collector has preserved the sharing of the
 * symbol [[b]] by two pairs. The same technique also
 * preserves cycles.
 * 
 * Prototype of a copying system for micro-Scheme
 * 
 * Although conceptually more elaborate than a
 * mark-and-sweep system, a copying system is easier to
 * build. You'll build one (\crefrange
 * gc.ex.copy-firstgc.ex.copy-last) based on the data
 * structures and supporting functions described in this
 * section.
