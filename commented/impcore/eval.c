 * Evaluating true definitions
 * 
 * [*] As noted on \cpageref

 * [[val]] and [[define]]. The extended definitions are
 * shared across languages; they include [[use]] and
 * [[check-expect]]. True definitions have an
 * operational semantics; extended definitions don't.
 * And true definitions are evaluated by code that is
 * explained here; extended definitions are evaluated by
 * code in the Supplement.
 * 
 * The --> relation on the true definitions is
 * implemented by function [[evaldef]]. Calling evaldef
 * (d, xi, phi, echo) finds a xi' and phi' such that \
 * imptopld -->\pxi'phi', and [[evaldef]] mutates the
 * C representation of the environments so the
 * global-variable environment becomes xi' and the
 * function environment becomes phi'. If echo is
 * [[ECHOING]], [[evaldef]] also prints the
 * interpreter's response to the user's input. Printing
 * the response is [[evaldef]]'s job because only
 * [[evaldef]] can tell whether to print a value (for
 * [[EXP]] and [[VAL]]) or a name (for [[DEFINE]]).
 * 
 * Just like [[eval]], [[evaldef]] looks at the
 * syntactic form of [[d]] and implements whatever rules
