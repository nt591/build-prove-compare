 * Function [[=alist?]] makes it possible to implement
 * sets of association lists, but it doesn't dictate how
 * . The wrong way to do it is to write a new version of
 * [[member?]] which uses [[=alist?]] instead of
 * [[equal?]]; it could be called [[al-member?]]. Then
 * because [[add-element]] calls [[member?]], we would
 * need a new version of [[add-element]], which would
 * use [[al-member?]] instead of [[member?]]. And so on.
 * The wrong path leads to a destination at which
 * everything except [[emptyset]] is reimplemented. And
 * then if anyone wants sets of sets, all the operations
 * have to be reimplemented again. The destination is a
 * maintainer's hell, where there are several different
 * implementations of sets, all using nearly identical
 * code and all broken in the same way. For example, the
 * implementation above performs badly on large sets,
 * and if better performance is needed, any improvement
 * has to be reimplemented N times. Instead of
 * collecting monomorphic implementations of sets, a
 * better way is to use higher-order functions to write
 * one implementation that's polymorphic.
 * 
 * Approaches\cullchap to polymorphism in Scheme
 * 
 * [*]
 * 
 * In Scheme, polymorphic set functions can be
 * implemented in three styles. All three use
 * higher-order functions; instead of using [[equal?]],
 * the set functions use an equality predicate that is
 * stored in a data structure or passed as a parameter.
 * The style is identified by the location in which the
 * predicate is stored:
 * 
 *   â€¢ In the simplest style, a new parameter, the
 *  equality predicate [[my-equal?]], is added to
 *  every function. The modified functions look like
 *  this:
 * <print.c>=
